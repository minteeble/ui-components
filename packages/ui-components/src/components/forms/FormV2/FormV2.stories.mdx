# Minteeble Form - V2

The **Form V2** represents a significant leap forward compared to the old form. The most important feature lies in the internal **data management**, which has been greatly simplified and made more streamlined and intuitive, while also resolving the state issues of the old form.

### Features

- The logic is handled by a custom hook (useForm). Through it, it will be possible to perform all operations on individual fields, such as adding and removing fields, modifying values, and many other configurations.
- Simplified process for creating new custom fields. The fields will depend solely on the form (rather than vice versa as in the old form).
